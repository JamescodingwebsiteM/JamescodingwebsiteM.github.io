		<h2>6th Grade Learning</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Microsoft word</li>
			<p> Microsoft word is a basic program that will be very useful in the future for high school and college. The reason being is that I know you will have to write a lot of essays and typing them would make then a whole lot better. This makes a lot of your work professional and will help you look good when making your resume for a job. Although these programs are pretty basic, they will always come in handy in the future and even though you won't think that it is that important, over time you will realize how useful this was for you.</p>
			<li> Microsoft Excel</li>
			<p> Microsoft excel is also a basic program that would be useful for many events. The part that I find the most use for this is recording past test scores and seeing how you have improved or have been failing. This may also come in handy for making a list of people for like a part or something so you know who to invite and their contact information or something like that. Excel is important but that has fewer uses than word but you never know, maybe it might come in handy for you path of career.</p>
			<li> Microsoft Powerpoint</li>
			<p> Microsft powerpoint I think the most signdificant program out of the three. This is the perfect program for creating a presentation for a job or a task. There are so many themes that you can choose from and so many effects you can add when moving from slide to slide. If you were to impress anyone for school, a job, or any kind of presenting, Microsoft powerpoint is the program to use.</p>

		<h2> 7th Grade Learning</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Photoshop</li>
			<p>Photoshop isn't really a good program that you would use very often but for some careers like photo editing or something of that sort it would. In photoshop, you can make so many effects on the picture and make it look so much better than before. you can add the smallest detail to make it perfect. The only difficult part is finding the picture and making sure you can use it. If you can't use it, it would be considered breaking the law.</p>
			<li>Illustrator</li>
			<p> Illustraor is more of graphic arts and you have to use the mouse to do the art, rather than in photoshop where the shapes are already made for you. I honestly like phototshop better due to the fact that it is cleaner and that I don't have to have a steady hand to make a straight line.</p>
			<li>Sketchup</li>
			<p> Sketchup is one of my favorite programs because it is the most realistic program that I know. What I mean is that it is 3-D and it gives you a perspective of you being inside the program. Also I like it because you imagination has no limit. You can download different things that would be in a real structure and make you structure look more realisitic. For all of the reasons stated, this is my favorite program.</p>
			<li> Floorplanner</li>
			<p> Floorplanner is a great program for people who want to go into a carrer pathway of being an arcitect. There are so many different things that you can do to design structures like houses and gives you measurement. Unlike Sketchup, floorplanner actually gives you the measurements that you can see and you won't have to somehow look it up. The only downside of Floorplanner is that you can't get a good quality 3-D view. Sketchup, is good for like renovating and showing your clients the house but Floorplanner is more lie blueprints. This the the acutal design where constrution works will build the structure and actually create these from the "blueprints".</p>

		<h2> 8th Grade Learning</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Filming</li>
			<p> Filming was a fun activity to do because you do a lot of fun stuff and refer to bloopers. Those are the best to watch because then you can laugh at them and make fun of yourself. This could also be for professional reasons such as a filming career like making movies or creating TV shows. A great program for this is imovie and you can use this for so many different projects. For education purposes, students can learn how to make movies and eventually enter into competitions and possilbly discover their career and make videos for a living. Also, because I know that youtube is very popular nowadays, youtube people with an account and post videos can use this program to edit their video to make it look better and more interesting for their viewers.</p>
			<li> Coding</li>
			<p> Coding is really amazing. If you actually think about it, coding is the source of all things with technology. Computers, programs, internet, and websites, they are all make from code like what this is. This website that you are looking at is made of code and you might have not even known it. Coding is one of my favorites subjects because it is so complex that when you look back at you code after you have created your webiste, it is really cool to see how much work you have put into you website.</p>
